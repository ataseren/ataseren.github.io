## What is Backrooms?

The Backrooms is a fictional creepypasta concept of an endless maze of randomly generated office rooms with yellow wallpaper and buzzing fluorescent lights. It has become an internet phenomenon, inspiring online communities, games, and even a wiki dedicated to expanding its lore. The Backrooms originated from a 2019 thread on 4chan's paranormal forum, /x/. A user posted an image of an empty, yellow-lit hallway with the caption "If you're not careful and noclip out of reality in the wrong areas, you'll end up in the Backrooms, where there is no escape."
