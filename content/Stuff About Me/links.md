I'm trying to be active in many platforms. Some of them are important, some of them are not. People may be interested in some of them, but may do not care a single bit about others. That's why I created this page. This page will be a **dump of links, profiles and contact information** about me. Of course I won't put my personal Instagram or Twitter (Yes, Twitter. Not X.) account because I think I shouldn't(?). But you will see necessary or unnecessary clickable stuff about me.

- [GitHub](https://github.com/ataseren): No need to talk about it. Even this website is hosted on GitHub. Recently, I'm giving it the attention that it deserved but I didn't give.
- [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ataseren/): It's kind of weird but I like to share this profile whenever and wherever I can.
- [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/p/slothtitan): Even if I know the topic, I like to solve the rooms. Other than that, their educational model works really well for me. I'm trying to spend some time on this platform every day to learn or practice my knowledge (and also trying to complete all rooms because of my progression addiction)
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/profile/ata_seren): I used to like solving coding challenges here. They were very helpful to teach me the programming language. They were very helpful in my exams too. I will try to spend some time in here too.
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/SlothTitan/): HackerRank but bigger and better. Though, I like HackerRank more.
