In this section, I will list my to-do's and ideas about improving this website. They can be about the design and structure of this website and new features I want to add. As usual, if you have any ideas and want to contribute, [please contact me.](/Stuff%20About%20Me/links.md/)

- ~~Add a gradient to background with relative color palettes for both light and dark mode.~~ (Gradient requires more complex design changes. Therefore, I adjusted the colors for now.)
- Add an index file under this directory.
- Consider the need for index files for other directories.
- ~~Check visit counter with Google Analytics.~~ (I used Umami instead. It is free, has a good UI, easy implementation and not overkill features like Google Analytics)
