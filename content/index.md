# What is this place?
Creating a website was always something I wanted but my procrastination demons were stronger. Yet, this website is here. 

In my website, I wanted to share about myself, my technical skills, store some notes, ideas, future plans and more. Basically, I wanted a digital playground about my life. Luckily, I learned about this _digital garden_ concept and realized that this is what I wanted. I can use this place to share and spend time on my notes about any topic I want, which I believe that it will help during my learning process and others. I can also create a roadmap for my future plans and get help, ideas and insights from people interested. Most importantly, I can tell people about myself, what I know, do and want.

Thanks to jackyzha0, I created my first digital garden with a simple but effective layout. I don't know how this will progress but hope both of us will enjoy the time spent in here.

# Who am I?

My name is Ata Seren. I'm currently a candidate engineer of red team in HAVELSAN. I'm highly interested in everything about computers since my childhood. That's why I studied computer science and graduated from Bilkent University in 2023. I always improve my skills of computer science in any area when I find the opportunity. However, the topic I'm interested mostly is cybersecurity. My interest to cybersecurity has started 3 years ago with an online training for CCNA exam. That training was mostly about blue team but I learned about cybersecurity and network fundamentals. Since then, I improved my skills about red teaming, penetration testing, development and most importantly, DevSecOps. I'm currently working on DevSecOps too and probably most of the content here will be about it. I'm also aware that AI and ML will have a huge impact in our future, just as they have in these days. Therefore, I will improve myself upon these and other topics of computer science too. 

Other than my education and technical background, I like to improve my mind, soul and life by reading psychological and philosophical books, trying to have good habits such as meditation and exercising, pushing and trying to increase my limits of working and find a good way to walk through my life. I will probably post content such as blogs about these topics too.

About my hobbies, I'm a dedicated gamer for more than 10 years. Gaming has an enormous part in my life. I will probably drop a Steam link in here somewhere, we can play if you want. Other than that, I play saxophone for more than 5 years. Instead of a hobby, I consider it as a necessity to have a better life but I love reading books, especially the classics. I believe people had more and better things to write and tell about. Therefore, most of the books I read are from 50+ years ago. I have a 3D printer and I love to print (and rarely design models) with it. I also try to sell some of my prints so I'll probably talk about it too. Finally, I love collecting stuff. I always try to start a new collection. Soome of them just ends with few pieces but some of them are continuing successfully. I have a big collection of comics of Uykusuz, a weekly comic in Turkey which I spent hours to read for years, postcards, souvenir coins and Hot Wheels and other 1:64 diecast cars.

Well, I think that's all about me. Maybe I'll add something in this section when something comes up to my mind. Thanks for getting to know me.
